Much like [[Obsidian]], [[Zotero]] is quite basic to start with but can get really powerful with a few plugins.

# Plugins

Install plugins by downloading the `.xpi` file and then going to 
```
[[Zotero]]>Tools>Add ons>Install Add on from file...
```

These are the plugins I use:
- [[Zotero browser extension]]
- [[Zotero - Better Bibtex]]
- [[Zotero - Zotfile]]
- [[Zotero citation counts manager]]
- [[Zotero - MarkDB]]

There are many more [add ons](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins) if you want to experiment

For example, I just found this [plugin](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-better-notes) that looks really useful for note taking in [[Obsidian]]
