>  Yay, you installed Obsidian. For a nice guide, look at the [documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian/Index)

In this Vault (fancy name for folder) I will cover how to use [[Obsidian]], [[Zotero]] and [[git]] in academia. The point of doing this inside [[Obsidian]] is to **show** you how it works, meaning I have included some essential plugins and custom templates that I use regularly.

Continue reading this note to learn more about [[Obsidian]]. Then I would suggest reading [[Using citations with Obsidian and Zotero]] which gives an overview, before actually installing [[Zotero]].

# Philosophy

[[Obsidian]] is a note taking app, where essentially you are just editing text files with a few extra bells and whistles. 

This is a different approach to some apps like [[Notion]], where everything is online and you don't actually have your own data locally. Therefore, if you plan to take notes for a long time you don't really want to rely on a company to store your data.

> [!important] 
> If the company behind [[Obsidian]] ever went down then you would still just have all your notes on your computer. They are just text files so could be imported into a new app

> [!tip] 
> There is another similar app called [[logseq]], which actually has a really nice [guide](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/start%20here) to why this type of note taking may be better for you

The idea behind this kind of note taking app is that we should forget about folder structure and instead just start writing down ideas.

By linking these ideas together, _structure can naturally form_ that matches your way of thinking.

# Concepts

This file will act as the contents for the tutorial on [[Obsidian]]. Click on each link to open up the respective note (`ctrl+click` will open the note in a new window).

1. [[Obsidian - Syntax]]
2. [[Obsidian - wiki link]]
3. [[Obsidian - useful shortcuts]]
4. [[Obsidian - Plugins]]
5. [[Obsidian - tags]]

To open any note, either find it on the left panel or type `ctrl+o` and search for a file name.

# Syncing
There are several options to back up and sync your vault across different devices.

Easiest way to do this is with [[Obsidian - sync]] that’s costs $10 a month.

Because I’m a cheap skate, I use the [[Obsidian git plugin]] to back up to [[GitHub]] and then [[pull]] the changes to my phone.

If that sounds too complicated then you can sync with other [[cloud services]] like OneDrive and iCloud.

# Tips

I like to use notes to keep track of who suggested an idea, like [[Simon]] said…

This can also be useful in a conference to keep track of who someone is and what they work on.

# Beware the rabbit hole

This setup took me quite a while to make, and involved a deep dive in the rabbit hole. [[Obsidian]] is always changing and there are so many [[Obsidian - Plugins|plugins]] its hard to keep up.

> [!info] 
> Try out this setup and tweak it to suit you. Usually these changes can be made in the settings for each [[Obsidian - Plugins|plugin]], or go on the obsidian forums

> [!tip] 
> If you think of a good idea, someone has probably made a plugin for it
